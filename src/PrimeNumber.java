/*The checkPrime method takes an integer n as input and checks whether it is a prime number or not.
Inside the checkPrime method:
It initializes variables i, m, and flag.
It calculates m as half of n.
It checks if n is equal to 0 or 1, in which case it prints that the number is not prime.
Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to m to check for factors of n.
If any factor is found, it sets the flag to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
If no factor is found (flag remains 0), it prints that the number is prime.
In the main method:
It calls the checkPrime method with different integer arguments to test prime numbers.*/
